 Browser-based word guessing game 'Phrase Hunter'

 In this project, JavaScript and OOP are used to select a random hidden phrase, which a player tries to guess by clicking letters on an onscreen or on a physical computer keyboard.  
 
 There are two JavaScript classes with specific properties and methods: 

 1. A Game class for managing the game 
 2. A Phrase class for creating an array of Phrase objects 
 
 The provided styles.css file was updated:
 1. Linear gradient is used for background images and buttons 
 2. Text shadows are used for headings 
 3. Box-shadow is used for letters in phrases to give them a 3D view
